       When running _x_t_r_a_b_a_c_k_u_p_-_h_e_l_p_e_r_._p_l you can specify the mode with "-m" /
       "--mode" (default: "list").

       "list"
           Lists all backups (full and incremental) in an orderd list. The
           oldest backup is printed first (at the beginning / top), the most
           recent backup ist printed last (at the bottom / end). Indeted
           backups show an incremental backup which is based on the backup
           right above.

           Example listing:

               user@host# xtrabackup-helper.pl -m list

               2013-07-04_14-14-51
                   2013-07-04_14-18-57
               user@host#

       "restore"
           Restores the a backup. If no "-r" / "--restore" is given, the most
           recent backup gets restored.  Other (older backups) can be selected
           by the identifier / date from the "list" mode.

       "backup"
           Performs the backup of the database server. It does an incremental
           backup, except the following is true:

           路   There is no other full backup

           路   The current day of week (determined by "date '+%u'") is the
               same as the one given via "--full-day" (which defaults to 1 /
               monday).

       "update"
           The script loads the newest version of itself from github and
           replaces itself

       "wedge"

       "--mode", "-m"
           In which mode to run, see "MODES".

       "--dir", "-d"
           The base direcotry of the backuops. It defaults to
           "/var/backups/mysql/data/". This dirctory must exist.
           "innobackupex" then puts its default directory structure in there,
           so one ends up with a subdirectory for every single backup.

       "--restore", "-r"
           Which backup to restore. Defaults to the most recent one.

       "--out", "-o"
           The directory wher to restore to.

       "--chown", "-c"
           A user (or uid) and optionaly a group (or gid) to "chmod" all files
           in the "out" directory to.  If both user and group are given, they
           need to be seperated by ":".

       "--force", "-f"
           If the "out" directory is not empty one can force a cleanup with
           this option. AATTTTEENNTTIIOONN: all files in the "out" directory are
           deleted!

       "--full-day"
           The day of week when a full backup should be made. Defaults to 1
           which means monday.

       "--man", "--help", "-h"
           Displays this help /  manpage.
