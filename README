NAME
    xtrabackup-helper.pl

MODES
    When running *xtrabackup-helper.pl* you can specify the mode with "-m" /
    "--mode" (default: "list").

    "list"
        Lists all backups (full and incremental) in an orderd list. The
        oldest backup is printed first (at the beginning / top), the most
        recent backup ist printed last (at the bottom / end). Indeted
        backups show an incremental backup which is based on the backup
        right above.

        Example listing:

            user@host# xtrabackup-helper.pl -m list
    
            2013-07-04_14-14-51
                2013-07-04_14-18-57
            user@host#

    "restore"
        Restores the a backup. If no "-r" / "--restore" is given, the most
        recent backup gets restored. Other (older backups) can be selected
        by the identifier / date from the "list" mode.

    "backup"
        Performs the backup of the database server. It does an incremental
        backup, except the following is true:

        *   There is no other full backup

        *   The current day of week (determined by "date '+%u'") is the same
            as the one given via "--full-day" (which defaults to 1 /
            monday).

    "update"
        The script loads the newest version of itself from github and
        replaces itself

    "weedout"
        Deletes old backups. See: "--keep-days".

OPTIONS
    "--mode", "-m"
        In which mode to run, see "MODES".

    "--dir", "-d"
        The base directory of the backups. It defaults to
        "/var/backups/mysql/data/". This dirctory must exist. "innobackupex"
        then puts its default directory structure in there, so one ends up
        with a subdirectory for every single backup.

    "--restore", "-r"
        Which backup to restore. Defaults to the most recent one.

    "--out", "-o"
        The directory where to restore to.

    "--chown", "-c"
        A user (or uid) and optionaly a group (or gid) to "chmod" all files
        in the "out" directory to. If both user and group are given, they
        need to be seperated by ":".

    "--force", "-f"
        If the "out" directory is not empty one can force a cleanup with
        this option. ATTENTION: all files in the "out" directory are
        deleted!

    "--full-day"
        The day of week when a full backup should be made. Defaults to 1
        which means monday.

    "--man", "--help", "-h"
        Displays this help / manpage.

    "--keep-days", "-k"
        This is the minimum of days in the past where it's possible to
        restore a backup from. defaults to 7. This means, that e.g. full
        backups can be older than this setting, because an incremental
        backup, which is younger is based on that full backup.
